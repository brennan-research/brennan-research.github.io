# Ecological and evolutionary genomics at GEOMAR

The ecological and evolutionary genomics group at [GEOMAR](https://www.geomar.de/en/) seeks to understand how species rapidly evolve across environmental and temporal gradients and in response to changing environments due to human driven global change. 

We use diverse approaches including physiological, transcriptomic, and population genomics to investigate the mechanistic and evolutionary underpinnings of ecologically relevant traits.

We are particularly interested in leveraging the interesting aspects of natural systems, such as salinity and temperature gradients, along with techniques such as experimental evolution in the lab to understand adaptive processes.
