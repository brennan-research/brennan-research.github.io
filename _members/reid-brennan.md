I am an ecological and evolutionary geneticist who focuses on adaptation to stressful environments. I am interested in how organisms can transition and adapt across environmental gradients and in thinking about how we can understand the potential for adaptation to human driven global change. I use a combination of field collections, lab experiments, experimental evolution, and various genomic approaches to answer these questions. I find it particularly important to integrate across fields and approaches in order to understand the complexities of natural systems. Further descriptions of my research focus can be found on the [research page](https://brennan-research.github.io/research/).

In my current position I am a junior professor (equivalent to assistant professor) at GEOMAR where I lead the Ecological and Evolutionary Genomics Group. Prior to this I was a postdoc at the University of Vermont working with [Melissa Pespeni](https://blog.uvm.edu/mpespeni/) on copepod rapid adaptation and experimental evolution to global change (also working very closely with the [Dam Lab](https://marinesciences.uconn.edu/person/hans-g-dam/) at UConn). I did my PhD work on the physiological genomics of killifish local adaptation with [Andrew Whitehead](https://whiteheadresearch.wordpress.com/) at UC Davis.
