Alexandra is a PhD student working on local adaptation in Baltic Sea copepods. She is interested in ecosystem change and what coping mechanisms can help organisms to survive in a changing ocean. Her work includes field collections, lab experiments, transcriptomics and population genomics. 

Alexandra is passionate about science communication and outreach. She is a [young ambassador]( https://www.marineboard.eu/our-current-ambassadors) for the [European Marine Board]( https://www.marineboard.eu) and when she is not in the lab enjoys drawing copepods to increase the excitement about these tiny but important organisms.
