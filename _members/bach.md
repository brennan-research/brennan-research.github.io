My name is Sophia and I graduated with a bachelor's degree in biology last year. Now I am doing an internship at Geomar to gain more practical experience for my upcoming masterâ€™s. The research group gives me the opportunity to get many different insights into marine biology and evolutionary genomics. Currently, I am working with marine zooplankton and testing copepods for their thermal tolerance in regard to climate change. In doing so, I am incorporating findings from Alexandra's MS thesis, which investigated the effects of plasticity and adaptation on seasonal variation in thermal tolerance in the calanoid copepod Acartia spp.
