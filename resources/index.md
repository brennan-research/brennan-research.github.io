## Protocols
Below are a number of protocols I've used, modified, and tried to write up in a clear manner. Feel free to contact me with any questions.

### DNA Extraction

A dirt cheap DNA extraction. About $0.70/sample. Gives great yield, high MW, and only takes ~2 hours (after digestion). I've never had this fail, but have only ever tested it with fin clips or whole fry.

### RAD-seq library preps

#### BestRAD library prep

This is modified from a protocol developed by Mike Miller's lab at UCD. 
Ali, Omar A., et al. "RAD capture (Rapture): flexible and efficient sequence-based genotyping." Genetics 202.2 (2016): 389-400.

​There have been a number of iterations of this protocol. If the link below seems out of date, I probably have a newer one that might be a bit more thorough.
