Thanks for your interest in the group! Before continuing, I encourage you to take a close look at our ongoing research and publications to make sure our interests align. 

Still interested, see below!

For potential graduate students, here are a few resources that will help prepare you during your application process:

- [So you want to go to grad school? Nail the inquiry email!](https://contemplativemammoth.com/2013/04/08/so-you-want-to-go-to-grad-school-nail-the-inquiry-email/)
- [What matters in a PhD advisor?](https://www.science.org/content/article/what-matters-phd-adviser-here-s-what-research-says)

## Interns, erasmus, and undergraduates

We are always interested in potential interns, erasmus, or other undergraduate students. There are a variety of small projects students can take on and these can be tailored to a student's interest. 

Please [contact me](https://brennan-research.github.io/contact/) explaining your interest in working in the group, your background, and what you're hoping to learn in the group.

## Master's students:

Masters students are enrolled in the [biological oceanography program](https://www.geomar.de/en/studying/msc-biological-oceanography). 

Typically, students apply directly to the program and later find a thesis advisor. However, if you're interested in working in the group, it would be to your benefit to be in [contact](https://brennan-research.github.io/contact/) before applying and I am always happy to talk with students. 

The application deadline is March 1 to April 15, 2024. 

## PhD students:

PhD positions are typically only available with successful grant funding. There are currently no open PhD positions in the group. 

If positions become available, they will be posted prominantly on this website.

I am always happy to work with PhD students who are not directly in my group or who have other funding sources. Please get in touch if this is you.


## Postdoc fellows

We are excited to work with postdocs who have shared interests in ecology or evolution. 

When funding opportunities are available, we will make them clear on this website. We have no current funding for postdoctoral positions. 

When no funding is available, we are open to discussing funding possibilities (fellowships, etc.) with candidates who would be a good addition to the group.

Potential fellowships include:

- [Marie Curie Fellowship](https://marie-sklodowska-curie-actions.ec.europa.eu/actions/postdoctoral-fellowships). Typically due in September. 
- [Walter Benjamin Programme](https://www.dfg.de/en/research_funding/programmes/individual/walter_benjamin/index.html). No deadline for submission
