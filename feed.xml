<p>The first is from <a href="https://www.uni-kiel.de/de/forschung/forschungsschwerpunkte/kiel-life-science">Kiel Life Science</a> and provides research funds to add more sequencing, transcriptomics, and physiology to her existing project.</p>

<p>The second is the <a href="https://www.dfg.de/en/research-funding/funding-opportunities/programmes/individual/walter-benjamin">Walter Benjamin Programme</a>, which provides two years of funding to extend her current work! The phsyiological aspect of this work will be in collaboration with <a href="https://www.meike-stumpp.com/">Meike Stumpp</a> at CAU.</p>

<p>We’re excited for Jenny to uncover the genomic and physiological basis of seasonal adaptation in copepods!</p>]]></content><author><name>Reid Brennan</name></author><summary type="html"><![CDATA[Congrats to Jenny who has received not one, but two grants to fund her work on temporal seasonal adaptation in Eurytemora affinis!]]></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">2024 field collections begin</title><link href="/2024/04/11/fieldwork.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="2024 field collections begin" /><published>2024-04-11T00:00:00+00:00</published><updated>2024-10-23T21:04:01+00:00</updated><id>/2024/04/11/fieldwork</id><content type="html" xml:base="/2024/04/11/fieldwork.html"><![CDATA[<p>Field collections 2024 have begun!

<p>Gianina has done lots of cool work using a long-term dataset to understand how copepod body size and abundance respond to temperature changes and if these changes can influence biomass availability in the ecosystem.</p>

We’re fortunate that Sheena will still be at GEOMAR for the next few months, but will be sad to see her leave- she has been a wonderful member of the team the past few years. But we’re sure she will go on to great things. Congratulations Sheena!</p>
