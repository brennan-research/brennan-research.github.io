Congrats to Jenny who has received not one, but two grants to fund her work on temporal seasonal adaptation in Eurytemora affinis! 

The first is from [Kiel Life Science](https://www.uni-kiel.de/de/forschung/forschungsschwerpunkte/kiel-life-science) and provides research funds to add more sequencing, transcriptomics, and physiology to her existing project. 

The second is the [Walter Benjamin Programme](https://www.dfg.de/en/research-funding/funding-opportunities/programmes/individual/walter-benjamin), which provides two years of funding to extend her current work! The phsyiological aspect of this work will be in collaboration with [Meike Stumpp](https://www.meike-stumpp.com/) at CAU.

We're excited for Jenny to uncover the genomic and physiological basis of seasonal adaptation in copepods!
