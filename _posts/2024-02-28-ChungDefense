A big congratulations to Sheena Chung, who defended her Msc thesis yesterday! We're fortunate that Sheena will still be at GEOMAR for the next few months, but will be sad to see her leave- she has been a wonderful member of the team the past few years. But we're sure she will go on to great things. Congratulations Sheena!
